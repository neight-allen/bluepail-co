Outline:
We should be using LLMs to enhance our existing applications
We should be building new applications based that utilize LLMs
I said this in my last thing.

To add to that:
I am worried that the hype around AGI and the fear of people being replaced by AI is keeping people from remember how innovation works. Don't get me wrong. I believe that over the coming decades, work is going to look very different. But it already looks very different. I also believe that things are accelerating. But behaving as if we're going to have human level thinking in your software in the next few years is a mistake. I want to present another way of looking at LLMs:

I'm going to start by summarizing what I understand the prevailing narrative around AI:
Something like "AI just recently made a huge leap in intelligence, and it is just a few leaps away from being as smart as people. Once it's as smart as people, we'll be able to describe what we want, just like we do to humans, and it will do that for the cheap price of electricity and silicon.

Here's the thing. I don't think this is wildly wrong. But there's an implication that this will play out in a few years. Maybe you thin And the businesses trying to ramp up in AI are going to have huge profits, and people are going to be laid off in droves. But I would argue that 

This is not too unlike how we view technological disruptions of the past

- AGI is not here today
- Large Language Models are not AGI

But I think they are a technological disruption. And I think there's something to learn from past. Let's take a look at some recent technological disruptions.

- Mobile
- Web
- PCs

I think there are some patterns that appear

- Technology changes fastest when it's new, making it hardest to predict the future
- New technology needs input from engineers, managers, markets, users and policy makers to become what it's going to become. So don't just sit on the sidelines.
- New technology starts with hobbyists, then it finds its killer app, but then things get interesting from there.
- New technology can automate things we had humans doing before
